## Quiz 8 assignment
- **Imaging Technique Inspiration**
    - I really like the patterns in William Morris’s work. He uses a lot of flowers, birds, and leaves that repeat in a neat, mirror-like way. The designs feel calm, natural, and balanced, but still have a lot of detail. I want to use this style in my interactive project because it makes the screen look nice and organized. I think repeating patterns like this help people feel more relaxed while using the design, and it also makes the visuals more fun to look at.

- **Coding Technique Exploration**
    - To make this kind of pattern, I found a p5.js example called “Kaleidoscope.” It takes shapes and repeats them in a circle by rotating them around the center. This creates a cool mirror effect, kind of like a real kaleidoscope toy. It’s a simple way to copy the feeling of Morris’s patterns. It also lets users make their own designs by drawing and seeing how the pattern changes, which makes it more fun and interactive.
